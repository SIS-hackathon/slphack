            <p>
                <span class="q1">Do I need to fill out an application for each child?</span><br>
                <span class="a1">No, please complete only one application. This application will cover all students in your household who go to schools in this school district. You can complete the application here online, or you can complete a paper version provided by your students' school or school district.<br></span>
            </p>
              <p><span class="q2">Who can get free and reduced price school meals?</span><br>
                <span class="a2">Students in grades pre-kindergarten through grade 12 who live in a household with income below 130% of the federal poverty level, who are foster children who are formally placed by a court or a state child welfare agency, who meet the definition of homeless, runaway, or migrant, who participate in Head Start, or who live in a household where any family members receive SNAP, TANF, or FDPIR can get free school meals. Students who live in a household with income between 185% and 130% of the federal poverty level can get reduced price school meals.<br></span></p>
              <p><span class="q3"> I applied last school year. Do I need to apply again?</span><br>
                <span class="a3">Yes. Your student’s application is only good for that school year and for the first few days of this school year. You have to send in a new application unless the school already told you that your child is able to get free or reduced-price school meals for this school year.<br></span></p>
              <p><span class="q4">Will the information I give be checked?</span><br>
                <span class="a4">Yes, and your school may follow up with you to confirm information after they get your application.<br></span></p>
             <p><span class="q5">Can I apply if someone in my household is not a U.S. citizen?</span><br>
                <span class="a5">Yes. You or your students do not have to be U.S. citizens to get free or reduced-price school meals.<br></span></p>
              <p><span class="q6">Who can I get in touch with if I have questions or need help? </span><br>
                <span class="a6"> If you have questions or need help with this application, call or email your student’s school.<br></span></p>
